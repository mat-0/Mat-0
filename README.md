You can see my [curriculum vitae](https://github.com/MatBenfield/MatBenfield/blob/master/curriculum-vitae.md) and my [operating manual](https://github.com/MatBenfield/MatBenfield/blob/master/operating-manual.md). I also love listening to [podcasts so please help me find more](https://github.com/MatBenfield/TheChels.uk/issues/new?assignees=MatBenfield&labels=podcast&template=podcast.md). I am also compiling a repository of [engineering management](https://github.com/MatBenfield/engineering-management) too.

* [I occassionally blog here about stuff and things](https://thechels.uk). It also auto generates local weather, football fixtures, and latest stock prices as part of my morning routine. Built using github-actions, APIs, and python
* I have been playing with python, recently, and have created some twitter bots, most notably [tweeting breaking news](https://github.com/TheChelsOrg/bot_tocfcws_news)
* [Cheltenham open data](https://cheltenham-open-data.github.io) is an organisation that uses open data sources relevant to my hometown. Projects include using and archiving official government statistics of Covid-19, Food bank data, street crimes, where to go for lunch, and more.

## Now & Next

* [Now](https://thechels.uk/morning) and [What should I be doing next?](https://github.com/MatBenfield/TheChels.uk/issues/new?assignees=MatBenfield&labels=Next&template=next.md&title=Next%3A+)
> Based on [the now page](https://thenow.page) and an idea by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff)


## Repository naming convention

Repositories, where possible, are lowercase with underscores and follow the naming conventions below.

- Demonstrations or proof of concepts use the format `demo_name`.
- Boilerplate or templates are named in the format `template_name`.
  - where appropriate these are also published through github pages and will be available at `username.github.io/repo_name`.
- WordPress related content (mostly plugins) are all prefixed with `wp_`.
- Twitter bots are prefix with `bot_`.
- Standard repositories are named as they are, sometimes this might be a domain name e.g `thechels.uk`.
