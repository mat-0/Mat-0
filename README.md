<details><summary><code>Repository naming convention</code></summary>
  
Repositories, where possible, are lowercase with underscores and follow the naming conventions below. 

  
- For demonstrations or proof of concepts, use the format `demo_name`.
- Boilerplate or templates are named in the format `template_name`.
  - where appropriate these are also published through GitHub pages and will be available at `username.github.io/repo_name`.
- WordPress-related content (mostly plugins) are prefixed with `wp_`.
- Twitter bots are prefixed with `bot_`.
- Standard repositories are named as they are, sometimes this might be a domain name e.g. `thechels.uk`.
