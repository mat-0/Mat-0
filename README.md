## Repository naming convention

Repositories, where possible, are lowercase with underscores and follow the naming conventions below.

- Demonstrations or proof of concepts use the format `demo_name`.
- Boilerplate or templates are named in the format `template_name`.
  - where appropriate these are also published through github pages and will be available at `username.github.io/repo_name`.
- WordPress related content (mostly plugins) are all prefixed with `wp_`.
- Twitter bots are prefix with `bot_`.
- Standard repositories are named as they are, sometimes this might be a domain name e.g `thechels.uk`.
